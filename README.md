# **NPK Analysis and Crop Prediction**

  This project is aimed at analyzing soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium - NPK) and predicting suitable crops based on the analysis using machine learning techniques.

## **Features**

  NPK Analysis: Analyze soil samples to determine their NPK levels.
  
  Crop Prediction: Predict suitable crops based on soil nutrient levels and environmental factors.
  
  Real-time Data Integration: Integrates real-time sensor data for accurate analysis and predictions.
  
  Web Application: Provides a user-friendly web interface for accessing analysis results and predictions.
  
  Mobile Integration: Supports mobile deployment for on-the-go access to NPK analysis and crop predictions.
  
## **Installation**

  Clone the repository:
  
    git clone https://github.com/gadgil-atharva/NPK-Analysis-and-Crop-Prediction.git
    
  Install dependencies:
  
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
## **Set up Firebase:**
